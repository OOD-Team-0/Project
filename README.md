## How to Setup IntelliJ with this GitHub Project

1. Install IntelliJ (should be able to download professional edition with student email)
2. Have Java SDK (1.8 preferred) downloaded and in a known place, configure with IntelliJ
3. In IntelliJ's welcome screen, click `Check out from Version Control` then `Git`
4. If you haven't already, IntelliJ might make you ask which service to sign in to. Choose GitHub then sign in using your username and password.
5. After signing in, you should be presented with a dialog asking for URL and Directory. The directory doesn't matter too much, that's where the program will be stored locally on your machine. For the URL choice, you should have a drop down, in it one option should say `https://github.com/OOD-Team-0/Project.git`. That is this project. Click Clone.

You should now have the project cloned locally to your machine
